# Micro-service Architecture

## What is Containerisation?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## What is Docker?

Docker is the containerization platform that is used to package your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers to make sure that your application works seamlessly in any environment which can be developed or tested or in production. Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.

## Who is using Docker?

Docker is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators making it a part of many DevOps toolchains. Developers can write code without worrying about the testing and production environment. Sysadmins need not worry about infrastructure as Docker can easily scale up and scale down the number of systems. Docker comes into play at the deployment stage of the software development cycle.

## Benefits of Conterisation

- Portability

An application container creates an executable software package abstracted away from the host OS. Hence, it is not dependent upon or tied to the host OS, making it portable and allowing it to run consistently and uniformly across any platform or cloud.

- Speed

Developers refer to containers as “lightweight” because they share the host machine’s OS kernel and aren’t subject to extra overhead. Using a Docker container, you can create a master version of an application (image) and deploy it quickly on demand.

- Scalability

Application container technology offers high scalability. An application container can handle increasing workloads by reconfiguring the existing architecture to enable resources using a service-oriented app design.

- Agility

Developers can continue using DevOps tools and processes for rapid app development and enhancement.

- Efficiency

They require minimal startup times, allowing developers to run more containers on the same compute capacity as one virtual machine.

# Virtualisation vs Containerisation

Virtualization and containerization are the two most frequently used mechanisms to host applications in a computer system. Virtualization uses the notion of a virtual machine as the fundamental unit. Containerization, on the other hand, uses the concept of a container.
